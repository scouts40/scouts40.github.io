				<p>Robert Baden-Powell, born in 1857 in London, was a British Army officer whose expertise in scouting and survival during his military career inspired him to create the global Scouting movement. After his success at the Siege of Mafeking, he organized the first Scout camp on Brownsea Island in 1907 and published Scouting for Boys in 1908. This book introduced outdoor skills and a moral code to young people worldwide. Baden-Powell retired from the army to focus on Scouting, helped launch the Girl Guides with his sister Agnes in 1910, and was honored as Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell. He passed away in 1941 in Kenya, leaving a lasting legacy of empowering youth to become responsible and capable adults.</p>

				<p class="p1">Being a Scout means living with courage, kindness, and a spirit of adventure. We learn new skills, help our communities, and work together as a team. Whether we're hiking in nature, building something with our hands, or lending a helping hand, we always do our best and stay true to the Scout promise. It's not just what we do — it's who we are.</p>
