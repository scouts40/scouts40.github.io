				<p>Robert Baden-Powell (1857–1941)

Founder of the World Scout Movement

Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell was born on February 22, 1857, in London, England. He was the eighth of ten children. His father died when he was young, and Baden-Powell was largely raised by his strong and resourceful mother, who encouraged creativity and independence.

He joined the British Army at the age of 19 and served in various parts of the British Empire, including India and Africa. During his service, he became known for his skills in reconnaissance, scouting, and survival—skills he later saw as valuable for young people to learn.

Baden-Powell became a national hero during the Siege of Mafeking (1899–1900) in the Second Boer War, where he used clever tactics and trained young boys to assist in non-combat roles, such as messengers. This inspired him to think more deeply about the role of youth in society.

In 1907, he held the first experimental Scout camp on Brownsea Island in England. He then published "Scouting for Boys" in 1908, which became the foundation of the global Scouting movement. The book combined outdoor skills, adventure, and a moral code, and it quickly inspired the formation of Scout troops across the UK and beyond.

In 1910, he retired from the army to focus entirely on Scouting. That same year, he also helped start the Girl Guides with his sister Agnes Baden-Powell (later led by his wife, Olave Baden-Powell).

He was made a baron in 1929, becoming Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell (named after Gilwell Park, the Scout training center).

Baden-Powell spent his later years in Kenya, where he died on January 8, 1941, at the age of 83. His gravestone bears a simple Scout trail sign: ◯ with a dot in the center, meaning "I have gone home."

He is remembered as a visionary who gave millions of young people around the world the tools to grow into responsible, confident, and capable adults.</p>
